Poke-Mem

A game to test your memory skills

Project Status:

This project is currently in development. Users can currently choose from three difficulties and play a round of the game. When the user wis or loses the round a pop up displays their results and the user can choose to play another round.

Styling is in progress and currently only for portrait mobile screens and desktop landscape dimensions. Landscape styling to come.

Further features are to be developed starting with a round timer (to log how quickly the user beats a round) and leader board feature to upload your best score.
